Given an array arr[] of size N and two integers M and K, the task is to find the array element at the Kth index after

In a single operation, a new array is formed whose elements have the Bitwise XOR values of the adjacent elements of the

If the number of operations M or the value of K after M operations is invalid then print -1.
